## About

`discord-delphi` is a [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot that uses the [Delphi AI](https://delphi.allenai.org/) to provide moral and ethical judgements. Through the bot, users can have their messages judged for morality. It is developed in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and relies on the [Node](https://nodejs.org/) module of [delphi-ai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/delphi-ai).

The project was started in October 2021 using the codebase of the [discord-cleverbot](https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/discord-cleverbot) project.

## Getting started

### Creating a bot

- Create a new bot account in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
- Copy the access token of your bot for later.

### Setting up the code

- You will need an environment with [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed (or use the Dev Container - see the [Development](#development) section below).
- Run `git clone https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/discord-delphi.git` to clone the repo.
- Create a new file called `.env` and add your access token, using [`.env.example`](./.env.example) as an example.

### Running the code

- In the top directory, run `npm install` to download all necessary packages.
- Run `npm run build` to build the project.
- Run `npm run commands` to register slash commands with Discord.
- Run `npm start` to start the bot.

### Interacting with the bot

- In the **OAuth2**>**URL Generator** tab in the Discord Developer Portal, generate an invite URL with the `applications.commands` scope.
- Use the invite URL to add the bot to a server.
- @ mention your bot in a message and see the bot respond!

## Development

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the recommended IDE for development. All settings are included as artifacts in the [`.vscode`](./.vscode) folder and will automatically apply. You can use the built-in debugger and set breakpoints to troubleshoot the code.
